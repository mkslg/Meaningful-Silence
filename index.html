                        <strong>Dear future RN/Dr.,</strong>
                        <p>
                            I hope this letter finds you well. It's been what, like 3 or 4 months since the last time we saw 
                            each other? Man, it felt like a year already. Anyway, I hope you are doing fine. I see na focused 
                            ka sa acads mo, which is good. I hope you'll keep slaying just like you did sa Letran.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Enough with the chit-chat. I'll get straight to the point. As I said, it's been a couple of months.
                            We're both in our new environments, new people, new places. Yet, there's just one thing na
                            hinding-hindi mawala sa isip ko, and it's you. I don't know why, pero I really can't get you out of
                            my mind. I know na I've already been rejected and I've already tried so many times to move on.
                            I tried focusing on sports, I tried talking to other people, pero wala eh. Ikaw pa rin talaga.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We may not have a lot of memories together,  but some of my best memories in Letran include
                            you. Hinding-hindi mawala sa isip ko yung smile mo. The smile you showed me when I gave
                            you the crochet rose, the smile you wore whenever you performed, and the smile you showcased during our
                            graduation. Your radiant smile has been etched into the depths of my heart. I just wish that I 
                            could be the reason for those smiles.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On our last interaction before ka ma-hospitalized, it made me really happy when you said that 
                            you wanted to be my friend. I was over the moon. It just sucked na we never really develop that
                            friendship. It was my fault for giving up midway. I believe I never even greeted you on your
                            birthday because I was too busy that week, and nalaman ko lang 'yon when someone asked me
                            if I had already greeted you. It may sound like an excuse pero I really felt terrible about it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It's kind of awkward for me to say this once again pero, could I get another chance to get closer
                            to you? Another chance to be your friend? I know na you already gave me a chance before and
                            I wasted it. I want to make up for it, to really make an effort, and to really get to know you. I want
                            to be there for you through your journey and be your number 1 supporter. Lastly, I want to be a
                            friend who'll keep you company and be one of the reasons for those radiant smiles. I know it's a 
                            long shot, pero I hope you'll consider it in a positive light. No matter your decision, I'll take it as a
                            man and respect it.
                        </p>

                            Good luck, my future nurse/doctor! Keep your head high, I know your efforts won't be in vain.
